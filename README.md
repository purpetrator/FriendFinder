Compatibility is determined by the user's survey responses to 10 questions. Each answer has a value from 1 (Inaccurate) to 5 (Accurate). After the user completes the survey, the user's answers are compared against all existing records. The best match is defined as the existing user whose survey answers had the lowest absolute difference for all 10 questions combined.

### How to Use

Click "Take Survey" to get started. Enter your name and an image address URL to be entered into the friends pool. After you answer all 10 questions, click the "Submit" button to see your match.
